            <h3>
                Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest building-<br>
                construction projects, the Great Wall of China is widely thought to be about<br>
                5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed Chinese study, however, claims<br>
                the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). Work began in the 7th century BCE and<br>
                continued for two millennia. Although called a “wall,” the structure actually<br>
                features two parallel walls for lengthy stretches. In addition, watchtowers<br>
                and barracks dot the bulwark. One not-so-great thing about the wall, however,<br>
                was its effectiveness. Although it was built to prevent invasions and raids,<br>
                the wall largely failed to provide actual security. Instead, scholars have<br>
                noted that it served more as “political propaganda.”
