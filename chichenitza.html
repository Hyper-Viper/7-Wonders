                Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which<br>
                flourished in the 9th and 10th centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe Itzá—who<br>
                were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of important monuments and<br>
                temples were built. Among the most notable is the stepped pyramid El Castillo<br>
                (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the Main Plaza. A<br>
                testament to the Mayans’ astronomical abilities, the structure features a<br>
                total of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar year. During the spring<br>
                and autumnal equinoxes, the setting sun casts shadows on the pyramid that give<br>
                the appearance of a serpent slithering down the north stairway; at the base is<br>
                a stone snake head. Life there was not all work and science, however. Chichén<br>
                Itzá is home to the largest tlachtli (a type of sporting field) in the<br>
                Americas. On that field the residents played a ritual ball game popular<br>
                throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.
