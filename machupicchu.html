            <h3>
                This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham,<br>
                who believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used during the<br>
                16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Although that claim was later<br>
                disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu has confounded scholars. Bingham<br>
                believed it was home to the “Virgins of the Sun,” women who lived in convents<br>
                under a vow of chastity. Others think that it was likely a pilgrimage site,<br>
                while some believe it was a royal retreat. (One thing it apparently should not<br>
                be is the site of a beer commercial. In 2000 a crane being used for such an ad<br>
                fell and cracked a monument.) What is known is that Machu Picchu is one of the<br>
                few major pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact. Despite its relative<br>
                isolation high in the Andes Mountains, it features agricultural terraces,<br>
                plazas, residential areas, and temples.
