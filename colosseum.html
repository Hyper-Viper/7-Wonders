            <h3>
                The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the Emperor<br>
                Vespasian. A feat of engineering, the amphitheater measures 620 by 513 feet<br>
                (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system of vaults. It was capable of<br>
                holding 50,000 spectators, who watched a variety of events. Perhaps most<br>
                notable were gladiator fights, though men battling animals was also common. In<br>
                addition, water was sometimes pumped into the Colosseum for mock naval<br>
                engagements. However, the belief that Christians were martyred there—namely,<br>
                by being thrown to lions—is debated. According to some estimates, about<br>
                500,000 people died in the Colosseum. Additionally, so many animals were<br>
                captured and then killed there that certain species reportedly became extinct.
