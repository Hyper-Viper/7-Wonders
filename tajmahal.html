                This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s most<br>
                iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example of Mughal architecture. It<br>
                was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to honour his wife Mumtāz<br>
                Maḥal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their<br>
                14th child. It took about 22 years and 20,000 workers to construct the<br>
                complex, which includes an immense garden with a reflecting pool. The<br>
                mausoleum is made of white marble that features semiprecious stones in<br>
                geometric and floral patterns. Its majestic central dome is surrounded by four<br>
                smaller domes. According to some reports, Shah Jahān wished to have his own<br>
                mausoleum made out of black marble. However, he was deposed by one of his sons<br>
                before any work began.
