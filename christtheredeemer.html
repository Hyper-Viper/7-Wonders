            <h3>
                Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado<br> 
                in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date to just after World War I, when some<br>
                Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.” They proposed a statue, which was<br>
                ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul<br>
                Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was completed five years later. The<br>
                resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall—not including its base,<br>
                which is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched arms span 92 feet<br>
                (28 meters). It is the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world. Christ the<br>
                Redeemer is made of reinforced concrete and is covered in approximately six<br>
                million tiles. Somewhat disconcertingly, the statue has often been struck by<br>
                lightning, and in 2014 the tip of Jesus’s right thumb was damaged during a<br>
                storm.
