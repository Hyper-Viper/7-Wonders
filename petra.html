                The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley, nestled<br>
                among sandstone mountains and cliffs. It was purported to be one of the places<br>
                where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. Later the Nabataeans, an<br>
                Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during this time it flourished,<br>
                becoming an important trade center, especially for spices. Noted carvers, the<br>
                Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, and tombs into the sandstone, which<br>
                changed color with the shifting sun. In addition, they constructed a water<br>
                system that allowed for lush gardens and farming. At its height, Petra<br>
                reportedly had a population of 30,000. The city began to decline, however, as<br>
                trade routes shifted. A major earthquake in 363 CE caused more difficulty, and<br>
                after another tremor hit in 551, Petra was gradually abandoned. Although<br>
                rediscovered in 1912, it was largely ignored by archaeologists until the late<br>
                20th century, and many questions remain about the city.
